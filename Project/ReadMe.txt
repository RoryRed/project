When the code for this assignment is run Each of the variables are summarised and written into a text file. The second part of the code under the comment #histogram creates a histogram for each individual variable. The histograms are then saved as a .png image to the document folder.
The final part of the code outputs a large number of scatter plots that shows the relationship between each individual variable to another.
The Data set was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris [1].The data set 3 different types of flower under investigation. The sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width were all recorded in cm. The data set was originally published in 1936 in the journal annals of eugenics.[2] A controversial journal that ended publication in 1954.The paper is still accessible through the Annals of Human Genetics. Through there archives they make the original paper available.
The data set provided in this paper was then famously used in Edgar Andersons paper the Species problem in Iris[3]. The data set is widely available and Easily accessible for beginner python users from the sickie learn package.[4]
The data set is commonly used when people began to learn python functions. Python is more versatile when creating graph and plots then using spread sheet software such as excel.  
Matplotlib can be used in a variety of ways such as the creation of subplots. How the key advantage over spreadsheet software is the ability to import a data file and allow for an experienced user to create graphs more quickly by using commands to create the graphs rather then inserting them and then manipulating the graph to the desired format. This allows for more complicated graphs showing  relationships between data with greater variety or consistence then spreadsheet software would allow[5]
